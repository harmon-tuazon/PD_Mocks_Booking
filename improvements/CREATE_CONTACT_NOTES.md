## 🎯 **Current State vs Desired State**

### **What's happening now?**
```
As of the moment, the objects are being created but they are not being associated properly. But the associations are failing. 
```

### **What should happen instead?**
```
That newly created Bookings (`2-50158943`) object should then be associated to the appropriate Contacts (`0-1`), Mock Exams (`2-50158913`). 
```

### **Why is this change needed?**
```
This will allow for better data quality as we can see the relationships of our data objects.
```
