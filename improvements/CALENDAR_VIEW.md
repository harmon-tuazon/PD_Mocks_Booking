```
```

## 🎯 **Current State vs Desired State**

### **What's happening now?**
```
Students currently view available exam slots in a basic list format on the booking page. They have to scroll through text-based date/time listings to find suitable slots, which can be overwhelming and time-consuming, especially when looking weeks ahead.
```

### **What should happen instead?**
```
Students should be able to view available Mock Exams (`2-50158913`) objects  in a visual calendar format, with:
- Monthly calendar grid layout
- Clear indicators for dates that have Mock Exams (`2-50158913`) objects scheduled on them versus dates that don't have sessions for them. Those dates in the calendar who don't have a mock exam should not be interactable.
- Once they click a date that has Mock Exam sessions, a drawer will appear showing the sessions available in a list format.
- The calendar will only display the current month

```

### **Why is this change needed?**
```
Improves user experience by providing a more intuitive way to browse and select exam dates. Reduces booking friction and helps students better plan their study schedule by seeing availability at a glance.
