## 📋 **Improvement Summary**

### **Brief Description** (1-2 sentences)
```
UI improvements regarding the booking confirmation found at this endpoint: https://mocks-booking-api.vercel.app/book/[:id]. Instead of showing the current view (screenshots\Screenshot 2025-09-22 160536.png), that shows a continuous validation loop when the validation of tokens fails, we must show a card that instructs users to get in touch with info@prepdoctors.com or call +1 855-397-7737. There must also be a button to redirect to this page https://ca.prepdoctors.com/academic-advisors. 

```
