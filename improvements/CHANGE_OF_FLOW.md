## üìã **Improvement Summary**

### **Brief Description** (1-2 sentences)
Change the general flow of the application. Instead of the landing page showing the exam types to choose from, make the landing page the asks the user to input their `student id` and their `email`. Once they have "logged-in", only then will they be able to choose which mock type to view. 

```
```

## üéØ **Current State vs Desired State**

### **What's happening now?**
```
As of the moment, the landing page shows the users the mock types to choose from. Then, they will be presented with the different available sessions to book from. After choosing a specific mock exam session, only then will they be asked for their `student id` and their `email`. Once they input these, they will submit using the "Check Eligibility" button. The application will then perform checks whether this trainee has enough tokens to proceed with booking. 

```

### **What should happen instead?**
```
The landing page should straight away ask the user to input their `student id` and their `email` as a form of login. Once they have submit the form, the application should perform a GET request to Hubspot Contact (`0-1`) object to check if there is indeed an existing user under that student id. If there is no user under that student ID, keep the existing behavior of showing a snack bar showing that there is no user under that student id (no redirection needed). If there is a user under that student ID, then redirect them to a page where they can select which mock type to choose.

Once users have selected which mock type, show them available mock exam sessions (Mock Exams (`2-50158913`)). Once they have selected a specific Mock Exams (`2-50158913`) object. They will then be asked for the following information via a field :`dominant_hand`: a boolean with true for right handed option and false for left handed. Once they click a submit button to confirm their booking only then will the following behaviors take place:
-validation of token occurs. if they don't have enough tokens they are redirected to an error page
-once validation passes and it is confirmed that there are enough tokens, then the appropriate Bookings (`2-50158943`) will be created on Hubspot and associated properly.

**IMPORTANT: DO NOT CHANGE THE ORDER OF OPERATIONS WHEN IT COMES TO VALIDATION AND BOOKINGS OBJECT CREATION. USER TOKENS MUST BE VALIDATED FIRST BEFORE OBJECT CREATION AND ASSOCIATION**

```

### **Why is this change needed?**
```
This rearrangement of the User Experience is vital to provide a more seamless experience for users. It does not make sense that users will be able to go through the rest of the pages if they are not even authorized to do so.

```
