## 🎯 **Current State vs Desired State**

### **What's happening now?**
```
- In the calendar view, dates are not aligned with the actual dates stored in each Mock Exams (`2-50158913`) object. 
- In the calendar view, the dates on the session cards are not being reflected accurately. It looks like a static value is used.
- In the list view, the dates on the session cards are not being reflected accurately. It looks like a static value is used. 
- The default right now is the list view. 

```

### **What should happen instead?**
```
- In the calendar view, dates should be aligned with the actual dates stored in each Mock Exams (`2-50158913`) object. 
- In the calendar view, the dates on the session cards should be reflected accurately based on the dynamic values being set upon object creation. It should also should be formatted in this manner: `{start_time} - {end_time}`. Note that these are new properties so we need to change our logic in the backend as well. 
- In the list view, the dates on the session cards should be reflected accurately based on the dynamic values being set upon object creation. It should also should be formatted in this manner: `{start_time} - {end_time}`
- The default view should be the calendar view. 


```

### **Why is this change needed?**
```
Improves user experience by providing accurate information stored in each object. 
```

## 📊 **Success Criteria**

### **How will we know this is complete?**

**Functional Acceptance Criteria**

1. Calendar View Date Alignment

 All dates displayed in calendar view match exactly with exam_date property from Mock Exams (2-50158913) objects in HubSpot
 Calendar highlights dates that have scheduled mock exams
 Empty dates show no exam sessions
 Multiple exams on same date are grouped under that calendar date
 Past dates are visually distinguished (grayed out or marked)
 Future dates are clearly selectable

2. Dynamic Date Display in Calendar View

 Session cards display real-time date values fetched from HubSpot API
 No hardcoded or static date values remain in calendar view
 Date changes in HubSpot reflect immediately in UI after page refresh
 Time format displays as {start_time} - {end_time} (e.g., "9:00 AM - 12:00 PM")
 Dates render correctly across all timezones
 Date format is consistent: Month Day, Year (e.g., "January 20, 2025")

3. Dynamic Date Display in List View

 Session cards display real-time date values fetched from HubSpot API
 No hardcoded or static date values remain in list view
 Date changes in HubSpot reflect immediately in UI after page refresh
 Time format displays as {start_time} - {end_time} (e.g., "9:00 AM - 12:00 PM")
 Dates render correctly across all timezones
 Date format is consistent with calendar view

4. Default View Configuration

 Calendar view loads by default when user accesses /book/exams page
 User preference for view is preserved in session storage
 Toggle between calendar and list view works seamlessly
 Selected view persists when filtering by exam type
 URL state reflects current view (optional: /book/exams?view=calendar)

 **UI/UX Acceptance Criteria**

1. Visual Consistency
 Date formatting is identical across both calendar and list views
 Time display uses consistent 12-hour format with AM/PM
 Session cards maintain visual consistency regardless of view type
 Loading states show skeleton loaders for date/time fields
 Error states display fallback message if dates cannot be fetched

Example:
- Users can successfully book exams without errors
- Association appears correctly in HubSpot
- Page loads in under 2 seconds
