# Feature Template
## PrepDoctors HubSpot Automation Framework
---

## FEATURE: [Feature Name]
**Brief Description**: This is a full-stack application for mock exam bookings. It will use Hubspot as the database, Express.js as the backend framework, React.js as the frontend framework.

**Business Value**: It will allow us to host our own booking system based on objects and information on Hubspot. This will allow us to have the same flexibility as any booking system such Calendly without the need of using these external systems. 

**Framework Alignment**: It will use Hubspot as the database and single source of truth. It will make use of the following Hubspot objects:
- Bookings (`2-50158943`)
- Mock Exams (`2-50158913`)
- Enrollments (`2-41701559`)
- Contacts (`0-1`)

**Logic Flow**
The frontend booking page will make use of Mock Exams (`2-50158913`) as the primary object. Using the `exam_date` property it will show a date when an exam session is bookable using the front end. The `capacity` property then determines how many slots can be booked for each given `mock_exam_id`. The front end will retrieve all Mock Exams (`2-50158913`) with the `is_active` set to the value True. It will then display these as bookable sessions.

First a user will be asked to input their student id and email. Once we have those responses, an API call will be used to fetch certain properties from the Contacts (`0-1`) object depending on `mock-type` property of the Mock Exams (`2-50158913`) object using those properties to do a search for that specific user on Hubspot. The following logic will dictate what property from Contacts (`0-1`) object will be fetched:
- If the `mock-type` property is equal to 'Situational Judgment': fetch `sj_credits` and `shared_mock_credits`
- If the `mock-type` property is equal to 'Clinical Skills': fetch `cs_credits` and `shared_mock_credits`
- If the `mock-type` property is equal to 'Mini-mock': fetch `sjmini_credits`

Then using those properties, it will check if the corresponding property is not equal to 0 or null. 
- If it is equal to or less than 0 or null then the user will be redirected to an error page. 
- If it is greater than 0 then the user will be allowed to book. 

When a user books for a slot in a mock exam, on the back end, a new Bookings (`2-50158943`) object will be created. 
That object will have the following properties whose values will be recorded from responses to form fields:
- `dominant_hand`: a boolean with true for right handed option and false for left handed
- `email`: a string reflecting the email of the user booking a slot
- `name`: a string reflecting the name of the user booking a slot
The `booking_id` field of the Bookings (`2-50158943`) object, which is the primary display field of the object, will be comprised of the following: "`name` - `exam_date`".
Each booking object created will then be checked against the capacity set. Associated booking objects cannot surpass the set capacity.
For each associated Bookings (`2-50158943`) object, it will increment the `total_bookings` property of the Mock Exams (`2-50158913`) object.

That newly created booking object should then be associated to the appropriate Contacts (`0-1`), Mock Exams (`2-50158913`), and Enrollments (`2-41701559`).

## Requirements Summary

### Functional Requirements
1. **Mock Exam Display & Filtering**: : The system must fetch and display all active mock exam sessions from HubSpot, filtered by mock type (Situational Judgment, Clinical Skills, or Mini-mock). No option to view all types together - a filter must always be applied.
2. **Student Eligibility Verification**: The system must validate student eligibility by:
Accepting student ID and email input
Fetching appropriate credit properties from HubSpot Contacts based on mock type:
Situational Judgment: sj_credits + shared_mock_credits
Clinical Skills: cs_credits + shared_mock_credits
Mini-mock: sjmini_credits
Blocking booking if credits ‚â§ 0 with appropriate error messaging
3. **Booking Creation & Management**: The system must:
Create new Booking objects with properties: name, email, dominant_hand
Generate booking_id in format: "{name} - {exam_date}"
Associate bookings with Contact, Mock Exam, and Enrollment records
Increment total_bookings counter on Mock Exam object
Ensure total bookings never exceed exam capacity
4. **Credit Deduction**: Upon successful booking, the system must deduct 1 credit from the appropriate user credit balance in HubSpot.
5. **Capacity Management**: Display real-time available slots (capacity - total_bookings) and prevent overbooking.
6. **Duplicate Bookings Management**: Users must not be able to book twice for the same date. A check on `booking_id` must be done to ensure that the trainee has no previous booking under the same session. 

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance:**
Page load time < 2 seconds for exam listings
API response time < 3 seconds for eligibility checks
Real-time capacity updates without page refresh

**Security:**
Validate all user inputs server-side
Secure API endpoints with appropriate authentication
Protect student PII (email, student ID) in transit and storage
Prevent duplicate bookings through idempotency checks

**Scalability:**
Support up to 500 concurrent users during peak booking periods
Handle up to 1000 bookings per day
Optimize HubSpot API calls to stay within rate limits (100 requests/10 seconds)

**Vercel Constraints:**
All API functions must complete within 60-second timeout
Implement pagination for large data sets
Use caching strategies for frequently accessed Mock Exam data
Break complex operations into smaller, atomic functions

  Search Mock Exams by is_active=true and mock_type
  Search Contacts by student_id and email
  Count associated Bookings for capacity validation
- Batch operations needed - Single record operations sufficient
- Association Management: Create bidirectional associations between:
  Booking ‚Üí Contact (many-to-one)
  Booking ‚Üí Mock Exam (many-to-one)
  Booking ‚Üí Enrollment (many-to-one)
- Property Updates:
  Increment total_bookings on Mock Exam after successful booking
  Decrement appropriate credit property on Contact after booking
- Rate Limiting Considerations:
  Implement request queuing to stay within HubSpot's 100 requests/10 seconds limit
  Cache Mock Exam data with 5-minute TTL to reduce API calls
  Use batch read operations where possible for efficiency

## Security & Validation Requirements

### Input Validation
```javascript
// Example Joi schema structure needed
const featureSchema = Joi.object({
  field1: Joi.string().required(),
  field2: Joi.number().positive().required(),
  field3: Joi.string().pattern(/^[A-Z0-9]+$/).optional()
});
```

## Testing Requirements

### Test Scenarios

#### 1. **Happy Path**: Complete successful booking workflow
- User navigates to `/book` and selects "Clinical Skills" exam type
- System displays available sessions with real-time capacity
- User selects January 20, 2025 session (5/15 slots available)
- User enters valid student ID (STU123456) and email
- System validates and shows 5 available credits (3 cs_credits + 2 shared_mock_credits)
- User completes form with name and dominant hand selection
- System creates Booking object with ID "John Doe - 2025-01-20"
- System associates Booking with Contact, Mock Exam, and Enrollment
- System decrements user credits by 1 and updates mock exam capacity
- User receives confirmation page with booking details
- Confirmation email sent to user

#### 2. **Error Cases**: System handles failures gracefully

**Insufficient Credits**
- User attempts to book Situational Judgment exam
- System fetches sj_credits (0) and shared_mock_credits (0)
- System displays inline error: "You have 0 credits. At least 1 credit required."
- System shows "Purchase Credits" link and alternative exam types

**Exam Reaches Capacity During Booking**
- User A and User B simultaneously book last slot
- User A completes booking first
- User B receives error: "This session is now full"
- System suggests alternative dates

**Invalid Student ID**
- User enters non-existent student ID
- System returns "Student ID not found in our records"
- User prompted to verify ID or contact support

**Network Timeout**
- HubSpot API call exceeds 60-second Vercel limit
- System returns graceful error with retry option
- Partial booking data saved in session storage

#### 3. **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions and unusual inputs

**Last Slot Booking**
- Mock exam has 1/10 slots remaining
- Multiple users view availability simultaneously
- First user to complete booking gets slot
- Other users see real-time update to "Full"

**Credit Boundary Cases**
- User has exactly 1 credit and books exam
- System correctly decrements to 0
- User cannot book another exam until credits purchased

**Special Characters in Names**
- User name contains apostrophes (O'Brien), hyphens (Smith-Jones), or accents (Jos√©)
- System properly escapes and stores in HubSpot
- Booking ID generated correctly: "Jos√© O'Brien - 2025-01-20"

**Timezone Handling**
- User in different timezone books exam
- System displays times in location's local timezone
- Confirmation shows both local and user's timezone

#### 4. **Integration Tests**: Cross-system validation

**HubSpot Association Chain**
- Verify Booking creates with all associations:
  - Booking ‚Üí Contact (correct student)
  - Booking ‚Üí Mock Exam (correct session)
  - Booking ‚Üí Enrollment (active enrollment)
- Verify rollback if any association fails

**Credit Deduction Sync**
- Confirm credits deducted in Contact object
- Verify total_bookings incremented in Mock Exam
- Ensure atomic transaction (all or nothing)

**Multi-location Booking**
- User books exams at different locations (Mississauga, Vancouver)
- System correctly assigns location-specific properties
- Address mapping works for all locations

Expected Load:
Peak: 500 concurrent users during registration windows
Average: 50-100 bookings per hour
Burst: Up to 1000 users viewing availability simultaneously


**Response Time Requirements:**
Page load: < 2 seconds
API responses: < 500ms for reads, < 2 seconds for writes
Real-time capacity updates: Every 30 seconds
Credit validation: < 1 second

**Vercel Limits Considerations:**
Function timeout: 60 seconds maximum
Booking creation must complete within 30 seconds
Implement request queuing for high-traffic periods
Use edge caching for exam availability data
Background jobs for email notifications (non-blocking)

### Acceptance Tests

1. **End-to-End Booking Flow**: Student can successfully book an available mock exam with sufficient credits
   - Navigate through all pages without errors
   - Complete booking within 5 minutes
   - Receive confirmation immediately

2. **Credit Validation Accuracy**: System correctly calculates available credits based on mock type
   - SJ exam uses `sj_credits` + `shared_mock_credits`
   - CS exam uses `cs_credits` + `shared_mock_credits`
   - Mini-mock uses only `sjmini_credits`

3. **Capacity Management**: No overbooking occurs even under concurrent load
   - Total bookings never exceed set capacity
   - Real-time updates prevent race conditions
   - Full exams clearly marked as unavailable

4. **Multi-Location Support**: Bookings work correctly for all 4 locations
   - Mississauga, Vancouver, Montreal, Calgary addresses display correctly
   - Location filtering works properly
   - Timezone handling accurate

5. **Data Integrity**: All HubSpot objects maintain proper relationships
   - Every Booking has Contact, Mock Exam, and Enrollment associations
   - No orphaned records created
   - Audit trail maintained

6. **Mobile Booking Experience**: Complete booking flow works on mobile devices
   - All forms usable on touch screens
   - No horizontal scrolling required
   - Buttons meet 44px minimum touch target
